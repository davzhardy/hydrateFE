# To-dos

- Logged-out navbar
- Footer
- When registerdialog opens query all usernames and email addresses so you dont hav to send server request to find out if it is taken or not
- Textfieldinput in autocomplete currently takes the Muiformcontrol full width, needs to be removed
- Standardise meal and drink area into one component

1) Move potentialDrinks from DrinkInput.js into state (and do same for meals)
